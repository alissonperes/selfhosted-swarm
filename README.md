# Local Docker Swarm Monitoring and Management Stack

This repository contains Docker Swarm stack files for setting up a **self-hosted observability and management platform** across two nodes.  
It includes monitoring, visualization, management, and proxy services ‚Äî all orchestrated via Docker Swarm.

## Stack Overview

| Stack File     | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `observe.yaml` | Deploys monitoring tools: Prometheus, cAdvisor, Node Exporter, Process Exporter |
| `tools.yaml`   | Deploys visualization and management tools: Grafana, Portainer (with Agent) |
| `proxy.yaml`   | Deploys Traefik as a reverse proxy and edge router                         |

## Services

### Monitoring
- **Prometheus** ‚Äî Centralized monitoring and metrics scraping.
- **Node Exporter** ‚Äî Host machine metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).
- **cAdvisor** ‚Äî Container performance and resource usage metrics.
- **Process Exporter** ‚Äî Exports information about individual system processes.

### Visualization
- **Grafana** ‚Äî Dashboards built from Prometheus metrics.

### Management
- **Portainer** ‚Äî Web UI to manage Docker Swarm resources.
- **Portainer Agent** ‚Äî Node-level agent for Portainer cluster visibility.

### Proxy and Routing
- **Traefik** ‚Äî Dynamic reverse proxy with HTTPS support for exposing internal services.

## Features

- üìà Full observability of nodes and containers
- üîê Secure HTTPS access via Traefik
- üñ•Ô∏è Easy management through Portainer's web interface
- ‚ö° Fast setup using Docker Swarm stack files
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Persistent storage for Prometheus, Grafana, and Portainer configurations

## Getting Started

**Requirements:**
- Docker and Docker Swarm initialized on one or more nodes
- Shared network across nodes
- Basic domain setup (optional, for HTTPS with Traefik)

### Deploy the stacks

1. **Proxy Stack** (Traefik):

    ```bash
    docker stack deploy -c proxy.yaml proxy
    ```

2. **Monitoring Stack** (Prometheus, Node Exporter, cAdvisor, Process Exporter):

   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c observe.yaml observe
   ```

3. **Tools Stack** (Grafana, Portainer):

   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c tools.yaml tools
   ```
